1. Better filter communications, for example:
	X Must contain <filter>
	* Logical operators such as AND, OR, NOT
	H Don't have to use 'word' or 'with' in the regex
	X Apply filter during find i.e. "Find package python only if begins with lib"
2. Numeric communication to packages, for example something like this:
	- User: "find package python"
	- Mycroft: "Got 3 Results"
	- U: "Read them"
	- M: "python, python3.6, libpython"
	- U: "Dscribe second"
	- M: "Describing python3.6"
3. Finish scripts that actually do stuff for APT, and extend to other package managers.
4. Think about security, need sudo for installations.
5. Add tests
6. Write another TODO.lst
