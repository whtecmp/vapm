Ok, so here is part of my code:

```
    @intent_handler(IntentBuilder('Search').require('search').require('package').require('package_details'))
    @adds_context('SearchResultsContext')
    def handle_search(self, message):
        package_details = message.data.get('package_details')
        words = package_details.split(' ')
        self.log.info('package_details is {}\n words are {}\n utterance is {}'.format(package_details, words, message.data.get('utterance')))
	...
```

package_details isn't refrenced anywhere else in my code.
However, if I query `find package python only if begins with python`, the first time `package_details` is `python only if begins with python`, the second time is `python only if begins with`
